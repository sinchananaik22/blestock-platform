BluStock – Social Trading & Learning Platform (Club Feature)
📌 Project Overview

BluStock is a next-gen social trading and learning platform designed for Gen Z traders and investors.
In Project 2, I built the “Stock Market Club” module, where users can create private or public clubs, share trade ideas, discuss market strategies, and collaborate on investment insights.

The feature aims to foster community-driven learning and increase user retention through interactive discussions.

(All sections are clickable for navigation; discussion & interaction features are integrated, ensuring scalability for future growth.)

Secure Authentication:
Implemented scalable login & session management with race-condition fixes, ensuring smooth redirection and consistent state management.

Designed to support thousands of concurrent users with Redis caching, WebSockets for real-time discussions, and cloud deployment on AWS.
